<div class="about">
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> On this page could be more content about me myself and I. I could optionally insert a brief bio here, e.g. where I went to school, where I studied that,
        where I now work and so on and forth. 
        Maybe even some of my significant accomplishments, awards, or recognition here - but nothing to mention so far. 
        </p>

    <ul class="info">
        <li><a href="#">@TwitterHandle</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Some website</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Another site you want to link to</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
